Notes:

1) Probably better to do the check in the (overridden) WritableFileChooser.approveSelection() method, to avoid closing and opening the dialogue to just shown the warn message.
2) Remove //menuExportReport.setText(Constant.messages.getString("exportreport.menu.export.label")); from ExtensionExportReport.java
3) ExtensionExportReport.java Look into type, List<String> instead of ArrayList<String> for entire project.
4) ReportFilter.java use a StringBuilder to create the string strExtension "All"  it's more efficient
5) Remove all @SuppressWarnings("unused") and remove what is actually not in use.
